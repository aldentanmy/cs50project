**Students**

You are automatically redirected to the "Students" tab when you first click the class homepage. This produces a list of all the
students who have also added this class to their account, along with their email and phone numbers. Click on the names of the
students to be directed to their user homepage. If you click on your own name, you will be directed to your own homepage.

**Calendar**

When you click "Calendar", you will be brought to a table where a list of available PSet party times are produced with date, time,
location, and notes. PSet party times that have expired are automatically deleted from the table once the date has passed. You will
also notice that next to the names of the students are either green or red circles. Green circles indicate that the PSet party is
currently going on, while red circles indicate that it is not currently in session.

Changing Status: You can only change the status of a PSet party on the rows that you updated, and only on the day of the
scheduled PSet party itself. On other days, there will be no button available. On the day of the scheduled PSet party, you will
see a "Pset On" button appear. Click on it to change your red circle to a green circle, indicating that you are currently working
on a Pset. When you are done with your session, click "Pset Off" (which takes the place of "Pset On" when your status is green) to
change your status to red.

Delete Entry: To delete a scheduled PSet time, simply click "Delete" on the row of the scheduled PSet party.

**Updating Pset Party Times**

1) To schedule a PSet party, click the "Update Availability" tab, which would bring you to a form to submit. You can only see the
tab if you have first added the class.

2) Enter the date, time, location and notes of your pset. Note that the calendar will not display entries with dates that are prior
to the current day.

3) Once the form is submitted, you would be redirected to the calendar page, where you can update your status if the day of the
scheduled PSet is today.

# Contacting Another User

1) If you see another individual is working on a PSet, by the green circle indicator, you can click on their name to be directed
to their user home page.

2) On their homepage, you will see a screen similar to your own user homepage, with a list of classes, and contact information.
However, at the bottom of the page is also a "Contact" button. Click it to send an email from the yalepsetparty@gmail.com email.

3) On the email submission page, enter the subject and message. PSet Party automatically adds your own email to the end of the
message so that the recepient can contact you via email to follow up. Hit send email when done.
