# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

1. Web app for students in a class to connect with one another and with upperclassmen who have taken the class before
- Students can indicate classes they're taking and would like to collaborate with others and seek help for
- Classmates can indicate availability of times/places they want to study or work together on psets
- Upperclassmen can indicate classes they've taken and for which they are willing to provide help and advice
- Students can link up with upperclassmen who've taken similar classes to seek help
- Possible extension: Classmates can ask questions and discuss with one another through a forum (kind of like Piazza, which not all classes use)

2. Platform for people to connect with others who want to do sports
- Students and members of the Yale community can indicate interest in sports they'd like to play recreationally
- Those with similar sporting interests will be able to find and link up with one another via the app

3. Dining hall food wastage reduction
- Reduce wastage generated by overproducing food due to inability to accurately forecast demand in each dining hall
- App for students to indicate dining places in advance
- Forecast future dining trends based on past data

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names, and who are their section leaders?

Mirilla Zhu (Section leader: Max Levatich)
Lee Tat Wei (Section leaders: Reese and Greta)

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Are these ideas feasible/practical?
Is publicity and usage of the product we create considered part of the project requirements?
